This package includes scripts for calculating two sources of non-linearity in beta frequency band-Intrinsic mode functions (IMF). These are the sharpness around the extrema of the beta-IMF 
and the intra-wave instantaneous frequency variations in the gaps between these extrema, -a measure of the degree of non-linearity in these gaps (DoNgap).

OFFx.txt and ONx.txt: example real raw local field potentials (LFPs) from deep brain stimulation electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus in a patient with Parkinson's OFF and ON their levodopa medication

Note: this package requires downloading subfunctions from fieldtrip toolbox (http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org)

SharpDoNdyn.m: the main function; this function shows examples of calculating the sharpness of the extremata of the beta-Intrinsic mode function (IMF) & DoNgap from real LFPs
(1)line 4-9 = load raw data(replaceable)

feemd.p: this function does the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) computation
IMFs = feemd(data,eps,NE,num); 
Input:
(1)data = single raw input
(2)eps = noise level(e.g. 0.1)
(3)NE = ensemble number(e.g. 100)
(4)num = number of IMFs(all decompositions determined by stopping criterion = -1)
Output:
(1)IMFs = IMFs decomposition; number of IMFs in raw data with time points in column

gapcdn.p: this function does the DoNgap computation
DoNgap = gapcdn(data,delt,gap);
Input:
(1)data = input with each column as different input
(2)delt = length of increment in time
(3)gap = time points excluded from DoN estimation
Output:
(1)DoNgap = single column; the last number is the overall DoNgap whereas the former ones are the DoNgap of different columns of inputs

Esharp.m: this function does the sharpness computation (edit from Voyteklab)
sharps = Esharp(data,Es,widthS,ampPC,amps);
Input:
(1)data = single raw input
(2)Es = time points of peaks or troughs
(3)widthS = Number of samples in each direction around extrema to use for sharpness estimation
(4)ampPC = voltage threshold
(5)amps = analytic amplitude of narrow bandpassed data
Outputs:
sharps = sharpness of each extrema
