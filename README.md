# Multimodal_Tools
 analysis tools

Tools for analysing data:
1) Computational model contains code for generating figures 8-10. Run PD_sim_master and PD_sim_master_coh
2) Delays contains a script that simulates and estimates phase delays in the high and low beta frequency ranges. 
3) VoxelWiseCorrelation conatins an exemplar script detailing how nifti format images from two different modalities (in this case tractography and MEG)may be corelated at a voxel wise level.
