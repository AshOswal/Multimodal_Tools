 analysis tools

Tools for analysing data:
1) Computational model contains code for generating figures pertaining to the computational model. PD_sim_master_coh will generate figure 7. Run PD_sim_master 
2) Delays contains a script that simulates and estimates phase delays in the high and low beta frequency ranges. This sort of analysis has been used to compute delays in Figure 4C. See also Oswal et al., 2016 for a validation of this method (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27017189/). 
3) VoxelWiseCorrelation conatins an exemplar script detailing how nifti format images from two different modalities (in this case tractography and MEG)may be corelated at a voxel wise level.
